# numbers

Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9],
the task is to print all possible letter combinations
that the numbers could represent. 
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is being followed.
Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any letters. All the mapping are shown in the image below

# example
Input: arr[] = {2, 3} Output: ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf 
Input: arr[] = {9} Output: w x y z
